# Markdown-to-HTML Utility

This is a _very_ quickly thrown-together demo/PoC.

**Steps:**

- Add Markdown within the input
- View raw HTML code
  - (for copy/paste)
- View preview of the HTML
  - (caveat: css files not included here, so will not necessarily reflect appearance when added to destination page)
